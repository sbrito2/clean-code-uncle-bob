AUTOMATIC CHANGE TRACKING

-Entity framwork is able to track the changes made to entities, so
the correct updates are made on the database when the SaveChanges
method of context is called.

-The Change Tracking tracks changes while adding new records
to the entity collections, modifying or removing existing entities.

-Every entity must have EntityKey (primary key) property in order to
be tracked by the context. Entity framework will not add any entity in the conceptual
model which does not have an EntityKey property

-DbChangeTracker class gives you all the information about entities being
tracked by context.
