/* Each exception that you throw should provide enough context to determine the source and 
location of an error. In Java, you can get a stack trace from any exception; however,
 a stack trace canâ€™t tell you the intent of the operation that failed.
 Create informative error messages and pass them along with your exceptions. 
 Mention the operation that failed and the type of failure. If you are logging 
 in your application, pass along enough information to be able to log the error in your catch.*/
